# Simon_Task_FU_22

This is the repo for a project done in the Introduction to Programming Course at the Free University of Berlin held by Ryszard Auksztulewicz.
For this project we were tasked to design and test a Simon Task. We created the experimental design and coded it in MATLAB using Psychtoolbox. 
During the course we behaviorally recorded our peers. Using this data we analysed the behavioral aspects of the Simon Tasks using MATLAB and Python.
